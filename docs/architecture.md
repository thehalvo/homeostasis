# Homeostasis Architecture

*This document contains high-level diagrams and explanations of the Homeostasis framework architecture.*

## System Overview

Homeostasis implements a self-healing cycle through six interconnected modules:

1. **Monitoring & Error Collection** - Captures logs, exceptions, and performance metrics
2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** - Identifies underlying causes of errors using rules and patterns
3. **Code Generation & Patching** - Creates fixes for identified issues
4. **Parallel Environment Deployment** - Tests fixes in isolated environments
5. **Validation & Observation** - Verifies fix effectiveness
6. **Hot Swap / Replacement** - Deploys validated fixes to production

## Architecture Diagram

*Detailed architecture diagrams can be found in the `docs/assets/` directory. The diagrams illustrate the following aspects of the Homeostasis framework:*

1. High-Level System Architecture
2. Component Interaction Flow
3. Self-Healing Process Flow
4. Module-specific architectures for Monitoring, Analysis, and Patch Generation
5. Orchestrator Flow

## Component Breakdown

### Monitoring Module

The Monitoring Module serves as the system's sensory apparatus, capturing information about application behavior and errors.

**Key Components:**
- **Logger** (`logger.py`): Intercepts and standardizes log events from various sources
- **Extractor** (`extractor.py`): Extracts relevant information from logs and exceptions
- **Middleware** (`middleware.py`): Provides integration points for different frameworks
- **Schema** (`schema.json`): Defines the standardized format for error and log events

**Functionality:**
1. Log interception from application services
2. Standardization of different error formats
3. Classification of errors by type, severity, and origin
4. Event publication to the Analysis Module

### Analysis Module

The Analysis Module processes error information to determine root causes and identify potential solutions.

**Key Components:**
- **Rule-Based Analyzer** (`rule_based.py`): Applies predefined rules to identify known error patterns
- **Rule Configuration** (`rule_config.py`): Configures rule sets and detection patterns
- **AI Stub** (`ai_stub.py`): Placeholder for future AI-based analysis capabilities
- **Rules Directory**: Contains specific rules for different frameworks and error types

**Functionality:**
1. Pattern matching for error classification
2. Root cause identification using rule sets
3. Solution proposal generation
4. Context gathering for patch creation

### Patch Generation Module

The Patch Generation Module creates code fixes based on analysis results.

**Key Components:**
- **Patcher** (`patcher.py`): Applies code modifications to fix identified issues
- **Diff Utils** (`diff_utils.py`): Generates code diffs for applying changes
- **Templates Directory**: Contains code templates for common fixes

**Functionality:**
1. Code retrieval from affected services
2. Fix generation using templates or custom logic
3. Patch creation for application
4. Hand-off to testing module

### Testing Module

The Testing Module validates generated patches in isolated environments.

**Key Components:**
- **Test Runner** (`runner.py`): Coordinates test execution for patched code

**Functionality:**
1. Setting up test environments
2. Executing unit and integration tests
3. Validating fix effectiveness
4. Monitoring for regressions

### Orchestrator

The Orchestrator coordinates the overall self-healing process.

**Key Components:**
- **Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`): Main coordination script for the healing process
- **Configuration** (`config.yaml`): System-wide configuration for the healing process

**Functionality:**
1. Workflow coordination across all modules
2. State management during healing process
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Deployment coordination
5. Process validation and completion

## Interaction Flow

The Homeostasis system operates through a series of sequential interactions between modules:

1. **Error Detection**:
   - Application services generate logs and errors
   - Monitoring Module captures and standardizes error information
   - Standardized errors are passed to the Analysis Module

2. **Error Analysis**:
   - Analysis Module processes error information
   - Rules and patterns are applied to identify root causes
   - Solution requirements are formulated
   - Analysis results are sent to Patch Generation Module

3. **Solution Creation**:
   - Patch Generation Module retrieves affected code
   - Appropriate fix templates or custom logic is applied
   - Code patches are created
   - Patches are handed off to Testing Module

4. **Validation**:
   - Testing Module sets up isolated environments
   - Patched code is deployed to test environment
   - Tests are executed to validate fixes
   - Results are reported to Orchestrator

5. **Deployment**:
   - For successful tests, Orchestrator initiates deployment
   - Fixed code is deployed to production
   - Monitoring continues to verify fix effectiveness

## Design Principles

Homeostasis adheres to several core design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed with clear boundaries and interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: The framework supports custom rules, templates, and integrations
3. **Safety First**: Changes are validated before deployment to production
4. **Incremental Healing**: Solutions start simple and can increase in complexity
5. **Observability**: All healing actions are logged and traceable
6. **Fail-Safe Operations**: The system defaults to safety when uncertain

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing Homeostasis in your environment, consider:

1. **Integration Points**: Identify where to integrate monitoring within your applications
2. **Rule Development**: Create rules specific to your application's error patterns
3. **Template Creation**: Develop templates for your codebase's common issues
4. **Testing Strategy**: Ensure comprehensive tests to validate patches
5. **Deployment Strategy**: Define how fixed code should be deployed (container updates, hot swapping, etc.)
6. **Security Boundaries**: Establish security controls for the self-healing process

## Future Architecture Enhancements

The Homeostasis architecture is designed to evolve in several directions:

1. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Integration of machine learning for error analysis
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Extending to support diverse programming languages
3. **IDE Integration**: Providing real-time self-healing suggestions in development environments
4. **Distributed Healing**: Supporting self-healing across microservice architectures
5. **Proactive Recovery**: Moving from reactive to predictive and preventative healing
