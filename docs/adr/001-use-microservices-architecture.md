# ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture

Technical Story: #ARCH-001

## Context

The Homeostasis framework needs to handle multiple concurrent self-healing operations across different programming languages and environments. The system must be scalable, maintainable, and allow for independent deployment of components. We need an architecture that supports parallel processing, fault isolation, and language-specific plugin development.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for independent scaling of components
- Requirement for language-specific processing
- Fault isolation to prevent cascading failures
- Support for parallel environment testing
- Ease of adding new language support
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent deployment capabilities

## Considered Options

1. **Monolithic Architecture** - Single application with all modules
2. **Microservices Architecture** - Separate services for each major component
3. **Serverless Architecture** - Function-as-a-Service for each operation
4. **Hybrid Architecture** - Core monolith with plugin microservices

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Microservices Architecture", because it provides the best balance of scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation while supporting our requirement for language-specific plugins and parallel processing.

### Positive Consequences

- **Independent Scaling**: Each module can scale based on its specific load
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't affect others
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different tech stacks
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different services independently
- **Easy Integration**: New language plugins can be added as separate services
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined APIs between services
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be updated independently

### Negative Consequences

- **Increased Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Network Overhead**: Inter-service communication latency
- **Distributed System Challenges**: Need for service discovery, load balancing
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Data Consistency**: Managing distributed transactions
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more complex

## Implementation Details

### Service Breakdown

1. **Monitoring Service** - Log collection and error detection
2. **Analysis Service** - Root cause analysis and error classification
3. **Patch Generation Service** - Code fix generation
4. **Testing Service** - Parallel environment testing
5. **Deployment Service** - Patch deployment and rollback
6. **Orchestrator Service** - Workflow coordination
7. **Language Plugin Services** - One per supported language

### Communication

- **Protocol**: gRPC for service-to-service communication
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous operations
- **API Gateway**: REST API for external interfaces

### Service Discovery

- Use Consul for service discovery and health checking
- Implement circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### Data Management

- Each service owns its data
- Event sourcing for audit trail
- Redis for shared caching
