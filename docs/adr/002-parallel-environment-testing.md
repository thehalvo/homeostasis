# ADR-002: Parallel Environment Testing Strategy

Technical Story: #ARCH-002

## Context

When the Homeostasis framework generates a patch for a detected issue, we need to validate that the fix works correctly without affecting the production environment. Testing patches in production is risky, and sequential testing in a single staging environment creates bottlenecks. We need a strategy that allows safe, efficient validation of multiple patches simultaneously.

## Decision Drivers

- Safety: Patches must not affect production until validated
- Speed: Multiple patches should be testable concurrently
- Isolation: Tests for different patches should not interfere
- Resource Efficiency: Minimize infrastructure costs
- Accuracy: Test environment should closely mirror production
- Rollback Capability: Easy to discard failed patches

## Considered Options

1. **Single Staging Environment** - Traditional staging approach
2. **Blue-Green Deployment** - Two production-like environments
3. **Containerized Ephemeral Environments** - Docker/K8s based temporary environments
4. **Virtual Machine Cloning** - VM-based isolated environments
5. **Serverless Test Environments** - FaaS-based testing

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Containerized Ephemeral Environments", because it provides the best balance of isolation, speed, resource efficiency, and production parity while supporting concurrent testing of multiple patches.

### Positive Consequences

- **Complete Isolation**: Each patch tests in its own environment
- **Concurrent Testing**: Multiple patches can be validated simultaneously
- **Resource Efficiency**: Containers spin up/down quickly, pay per use
- **Production Parity**: Containers can mirror production configuration
- **Version Control**: Container images provide versioning
- **Fast Provisioning**: New environments ready in seconds
- **Easy Cleanup**: Environments destroyed after testing

### Negative Consequences

- **Container Orchestration Complexity**: Need Kubernetes expertise
- **Stateful Service Challenges**: Databases need special handling
- **Network Complexity**: Managing inter-service communication
- **Resource Limits**: Physical hardware constrains concurrent tests
- **Initial Setup Cost**: Time investment in containerization
- **Persistent Data Management**: Test data lifecycle complexity

### Technology Stack

- **Container Runtime**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Environment Management**: Helm charts
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for stateful services

### Environment Lifecycle

1. **Provisioning**
   - Clone production container images
   - Apply patch to code
   - Rebuild affected containers
   - Deploy to isolated namespace

2. **Testing**
   - Run unit tests
   - Execute integration tests
   - Perform load tests
   - Validate performance metrics

3. **Validation**
   - Compare metrics with baseline
   - Check for regressions
   - Verify fix effectiveness

4. **Cleanup**
   - Collect test results
   - Archive logs
   - Destroy namespace
   - Release resources

### Resource Management

- **Quotas**: Limit concurrent environments (e.g., max 10)
- **Timeouts**: Auto-cleanup after 30 minutes
- **Priority Queue**: Critical patches get resources first
- **Resource Pools**: Pre-warmed containers for common services

### Data Management

- **Database Snapshots**: Use storage snapshots for quick provisioning
- **Test Data Sets**: Maintain sanitized production-like data
- **Secrets Management**: Vault for test environment credentials
- **State Isolation**: No shared state between environments

## Security Considerations

- Network policies isolate test environments
- No production data in test environments
- Temporary credentials with limited scope
- Audit logging for all environment operations

## Monitoring and Observability

- Prometheus for resource usage metrics
- Grafana dashboards for environment status
- Centralized logging with Elasticsearch
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
