## Formal Verification Frameworks

### Introduction

The academic formal verification framework provides tools for proving correctness properties of self-healing systems, essential for safety-critical applications and theoretical research.

### Key Components

#### 1. Academic Formal Verification Framework

```python
from modules.academic import AcademicFormalVerificationFramework

# Initialize framework
framework = AcademicFormalVerificationFramework()

# Create a thesis verification project
project = framework.create_thesis_verification_project(
    thesis_title="Formal Verification of Distributed Self-Healing Systems",
    research_question="Can we prove consensus properties for distributed healing?",
    hypothesis=["Distributed healing maintains system consistency",
                "Healing decisions reach consensus within bounded time"],
    system_model=my_system_model
)
```

#### 2. Research Model Checker

```python
from modules.academic import ResearchModelChecker

# Initialize model checker with educational features
checker = ResearchModelChecker()

# Perform verification with detailed explanations
result = checker.check_with_explanation(
    model=system_model,
    property=safety_property
)

# Access educational notes
print("Educational insights:")
for note in result.educational_notes:
    print(f"- {note}")
```

#### 3. Proof Assistant Integration

```python
from modules.academic import ProofAssistantInterface

# Export formal model to proof assistants
interface = ProofAssistantInterface()

# Generate Coq proof script
coq_code = interface.export_to_proof_assistant(
    model=system_model,
    properties=verification_properties,
    target="Coq"
)

# Also supports Isabelle, Lean, and Agda
isabelle_code = interface.export_to_proof_assistant(
    model=system_model,
    properties=verification_properties,
    target="Isabelle"
)
```

### Research Problems

The framework includes pre-defined research problems at different difficulty levels:

1. **Undergraduate Level**: Basic Safety Properties
   - Prove healing actions preserve invariants
   - Verify resource bounds
   - Analyze simple error detection

2. **Graduate Level**: Distributed Consensus
   - Byzantine fault tolerance in healing
   - Consensus protocols verification
   - Temporal property specification

3. **PhD Level**: Advanced Verification
   - Real-time healing constraints
   - Probabilistic verification
   - Formal semantics of healing

### Example: Proving Healing Correctness

```python
# Prove correctness of a healing algorithm
healing_algorithm = """
def heal_connection_error(system):
    if system.connection_status == 'failed':
        system.reset_connection()
        system.retry_count = 0
        return system.establish_connection()
    return True
"""

result = framework.prove_healing_correctness(
    healing_algorithm=healing_algorithm,
    preconditions=["system.connection_status in ['failed', 'active']"],
    postconditions=["system.connection_status == 'active'"],
    invariants=["system.retry_count >= 0", "system.retry_count <= MAX_RETRIES"]
)

if result.verified:
    print("Healing algorithm proven correct!")
    print(f"Proof technique: {result.proof_structure.proof_technique}")
```

## Curriculum Development

### Self-Healing Systems Curriculum

The framework provides a complete curriculum for teaching self-healing systems at various levels.

#### Course Modules

1. **SH101**: Introduction to Self-Healing Systems (Undergraduate)
2. **SH102**: Error Detection and Monitoring (Undergraduate)
3. **SH103**: Automated Healing Strategies (Undergraduate)
4. **SH201**: Formal Verification of Self-Healing Systems (Graduate)
5. **SH202**: Machine Learning in Self-Healing Systems (Graduate)
6. **SH203**: Distributed Self-Healing Systems (Graduate)

#### Learning Paths

```python
from modules.academic import SelfHealingCurriculum

curriculum = SelfHealingCurriculum()

# Get undergraduate learning path
undergrad_path = curriculum.get_learning_path("LP-UG")
print(f"Duration: {undergrad_path.duration_weeks} weeks")
print(f"Modules: {[m.id for m in undergrad_path.modules]}")

# Generate course syllabus
module = curriculum.get_module("SH101")
syllabus = curriculum.generate_syllabus(module)
```

### Creating Custom Lessons

```python
# Create a lesson plan
lesson = curriculum.create_lesson_plan(
    topic="Introduction to Error Detection",
    duration_minutes=90,
    level=EducationLevel.UNDERGRADUATE
)

# Generate interactive exercise
exercise = generate_interactive_exercise(

)
```

### Assessment Tools

The curriculum includes various assessment types:

```python
# Get assessment for a module
quiz = curriculum.get_assessment("QUIZ-SH101")
print(f"Questions: {len(quiz.questions)}")
print(f"Duration: {quiz.duration_minutes} minutes")

# Create custom assessment
assessment = AcademicAssessment(
    id="CUSTOM-001",
    title="Healing Algorithm Design",
    type=AssessmentType.PROJECT,
    module_id="SH103",
    description="Design and implement a healing algorithm",
    points=100,
    duration_minutes=720,  # 12 hours over multiple days
    questions=[...],
    rubric={...}
)
```

## Research Tools

```python
from modules.academic import ThesisVerificationTools

thesis_tools = ThesisVerificationTools()

# Create thesis template
template = thesis_tools.create_thesis_template(
    research_area=ResearchFocus.DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEMS
)

# Generate proof assistant scripts
coq_proof = thesis_tools.generate_proof_assistant_script(
    theorem="All healing actions eventually terminate",
