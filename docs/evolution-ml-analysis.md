# Machine Learning Evolution Path for Homeostasis

This document outlines the technical strategy and evolution path for integrating machine learning capabilities into the Homeostasis framework, moving from the current rule-based approach toward increasingly sophisticated AI-powered analysis and healing.

## Current State

Homeostasis currently employs a rule-based analysis engine that:
- Matches error patterns using predefined rules
- Uses template-based patch generation
- Relies on human-created rules and patterns
- Includes the `ai_stub.py` placeholder for future AI integration

## Evolution Strategy

The integration of machine learning into Homeostasis will follow a carefully staged approach, prioritizing reliability and explainability while gradually increasing autonomous capabilities.

### Stage 1: Rule-Based Foundation with ML Augmentation (0-6 months)

**Goal**: Enhance the existing rule-based system with targeted ML components that improve accuracy without sacrificing reliability.

**Key Initiatives**:

1. **Error Classification ML Model**
   - Train models to categorize errors into predefined classes
   - Use features extracted from error messages, stack traces, and context
   - Implement as a parallel classification system alongside rules
   - Provide confidence scores for classifications
   - Example implementation:
     ```python
     class MLErrorClassifier:
         def __init__(self, model_path):
             self.model = load_model(model_path)
             
         def classify(self, error_info):
             features = self.extract_features(error_info)
             classification = self.model.predict(features)
             confidence = self.model.predict_proba(features).max()
             return {
                 "error_type": classification,
                 "confidence": confidence,
                 "rule_matched": False
             }
     ```

         """Extract key parameters from error message and code context"""
         # Rule-based extraction
         rule_params = rule_extractor.extract(error_message)
         
         # ML-based extraction
         ml_params = ml_extractor.extract(error_message, code_context)

         # Analyze variable dependencies
         dependencies = extract_dependencies(ast, error.variable_name)
         
         # Combine with error pattern
         enriched_context = {
             "error": error,
             "ast": ast,
             "dependencies": dependencies,
