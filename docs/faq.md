# Homeostasis FAQ

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Homeostasis framework.

## General Questions

### What is Homeostasis?

Homeostasis is an open-source framework for building self-healing systems. It monitors applications for errors, analyzes their root causes, and automatically generates and applies fixes, mimicking the self-repair mechanisms found in biological systems.

### Why the name "Homeostasis"?

In biology, homeostasis refers to the ability of organisms to maintain stable internal conditions despite changes in the external environment. Similarly, our framework helps software systems maintain stable operation by automatically detecting and repairing issues.

### Is Homeostasis production-ready?

Homeostasis is currently in early development. The framework provides a proof of concept and demonstrates the self-healing cycle, but is not yet recommended for critical production systems. We're actively developing more robust capabilities and improving test coverage.

### What languages/frameworks does Homeostasis support?

The initial implementation focuses on Python applications, with early support for Flask and FastAPI web frameworks. However, the architecture is designed to be extensible to other languages and frameworks in the future.

## Technical Questions

### How does the self-healing process work?

Homeostasis implements a self-healing cycle through six steps:

1. **Monitoring & Error Collection**: Captures logs, exceptions, and performance metrics
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies underlying causes using rule-based pattern matching
3. **Code Generation & Patching**: Creates fixes for identified issues using templates
4. **Parallel Environment Deployment**: Tests fixes in isolated environments
5. **Validation & Observation**: Verifies fix effectiveness through automated testing
6. **Hot Swap / Replacement**: Deploys validated fixes to production

### What types of errors can Homeostasis fix?

The current version focuses on common, well-defined errors with clear patterns and solutions, such as:

- KeyErrors and IndexErrors in Python
- Common API validation issues
- Simple database connectivity problems
- Basic configuration errors
- Runtime exceptions with known solutions

As the system evolves, its capabilities will expand to more complex issues.

### How does Homeostasis avoid creating new problems?

Homeostasis employs several safety mechanisms:

1. **Isolated Testing**: All fixes are tested in separate environments before deployment
2. **Limited Scope**: Fixes are focused on specific, well-understood issues
3. **Fail-Safe Design**: If any step in the process fails, the system maintains the current state
4. **Human Oversight**: Optional approval workflows for critical systems
5. **Rollback Capability**: Quick reversion to previous states if issues are detected

### Can Homeostasis work with existing monitoring tools?

Yes, Homeostasis is designed to integrate with existing observability infrastructure. It can consume logs and error reports from:

- Standard logging libraries
- Centralized logging systems
- Error tracking services
- APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools

The monitoring module includes adapters for common formats and can be extended for custom sources.

### Does Homeostasis require machine learning?

No, the core functionality uses rule-based pattern matching and does not require machine learning. However, the architecture includes placeholders for AI-based analysis as an optional enhancement. Future versions may incorporate machine learning for more sophisticated error analysis.

## Implementation Questions

### How do I add Homeostasis to my application?

To integrate Homeostasis with your application:

1. Install the Homeostasis package: `pip install homeostasis` (coming soon)
2. Add the monitoring integration to your application:
   ```python
   from homeostasis.monitoring import setup_monitoring
   
   # For Flask
   setup_monitoring(app, config={...})
   
   # For FastAPI
   app.add_middleware(HomeostasisMiddleware, config={...})
   ```
3. Configure the orchestrator to watch for and heal errors
4. Run the orchestrator alongside your application

Detailed setup instructions are available in the [usage documentation](usage.md).

### How do I write custom rules?

Custom rules can be added to the `modules/analysis/rules/` directory in JSON format. Each rule defines:

- Error patterns to match
- Conditions for applying the rule
- Template and parameters for generating a fix

For detailed instructions, see the [Contributing Rules guide](contributing-rules.md).

### How do I create patch templates?

Patch templates are stored in the `modules/patch_generation/templates/` directory as `.py.template` files with placeholders for variable parts. For detailed instructions, see the [Contributing Patch Templates guide](contributing-templates.md).

### Can Homeostasis modify code across multiple files?

The current implementation focuses primarily on single-file fixes. Support for multi-file changes is planned for future releases. Complex changes that span multiple components may still require human review.

### How does Homeostasis handle version control?

Homeostasis can integrate with git to:

1. Generate patches in the correct format
2. Create branches for fixes
3. Submit pull requests for review (optional)
4. Apply fixes directly to working directories

The level of version control integration is configurable based on your workflow.

## Deployment Questions

### What are the system requirements?

Homeostasis has minimal requirements:

- Python 3.8+ for the core framework
- Docker (optional) for isolated testing environments
- Git for version control integration (optional)
- CPU and memory requirements depend on the complexity of your application

### Can Homeostasis run in containerized environments?

Yes, Homeostasis is designed to work well in containerized environments. The orchestrator can be deployed as a sidecar container or as part of a Kubernetes operator to manage application healing.

### How does Homeostasis affect application performance?

The monitoring component adds minimal overhead, similar to standard logging frameworks. The analysis and healing processes typically run asynchronously and don't impact application performance. For resource-constrained environments, you can configure the monitoring to sample errors or run healing processes on separate infrastructure.

### Is Homeostasis secure?

Security is a primary consideration in Homeostasis design:

- Code changes are limited to predefined templates and patterns
- All operations run with the same permissions as your application
- No external code execution by default
- Optional approval workflows for changes
- Integration with your secure CI/CD pipelines

However, as with any system that can modify code, we recommend careful configuration in sensitive environments.

## Contributing

### How can I contribute to Homeostasis?

There are many ways to contribute:

- Add new rules for common error patterns
- Create patch templates for fixes
- Improve documentation and examples
- Add support for additional frameworks
- Report bugs and suggest features

See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidelines.

### Where do I report bugs or request features?

Please use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features. Use the appropriate issue templates to provide all necessary information.

### Is there a community for Homeostasis?

Yes, we're building a community of contributors and users:

- GitHub Discussions for Q&A and ideas
- Regular project updates on the repository
- Planned community calls for major releases

## Troubleshooting

### Homeostasis isn't detecting my application's errors

Check the following:

1. Ensure the monitoring integration is correctly installed
2. Verify that your logging level includes errors (ERROR or above)
3. Check that error formats match what the monitoring module expects
4. Look for monitoring logs to confirm it's active

### The fixes generated by Homeostasis don't work

This could happen for several reasons:

1. The error pattern is not well-defined in the rules
2. The context doesn't provide enough information
3. The template doesn't account for your specific code structure

Consider:
- Adding a more specific rule for your error pattern
- Enhancing the context collection for better analysis
- Creating a custom template that better matches your code style

### How do I disable Homeostasis for specific components?

You can configure exclusions in the monitoring setup:

```python
setup_monitoring(app, config={
    "exclude_modules": ["sensitive_module", "experimental_feature"],
    "exclude_error_types": ["BusinessLogicError"]
})
```

This prevents Homeostasis from attempting to heal certain areas of your application that might require human review or have complex business logic.
