# Security Module for Homeostasis

This module provides security features for production deployments of Homeostasis.

## Overview

The security module implements several key security features:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Controls access to the Homeostasis system
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defines different permissions for users and systems
3. **API Security**: Secures API endpoints with tokens, rate limiting, and more
4. **Audit Logging**: Records security-relevant events for compliance and forensics
5. **Encryption**: Manages encryption of sensitive data

## Components

- `auth.py`: Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- `rbac.py`: Role-based access control implementation
- `api_security.py`: API security features including rate limiting
- `encryption.py`: Data encryption utilities
- `validators.py`: Security validation functions
- `security_config.py`: Security configuration utilities

## Configuration

Security settings can be configured in `orchestrator/config.yaml` under the `security` section.

## Usage

```python
from modules.security import auth, rbac

# Authenticate a user
user = auth.authenticate(username, password)

# Check permissions
if rbac.has_permission(user, "deploy_fixes"):
    # Perform privileged operation
    ...
```
