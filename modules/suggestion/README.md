# Fix Suggestion Module for Homeostasis

This module provides the ability for users to review and suggest improvements to automatically generated fixes.

## Overview

The fix suggestion module enables human involvement in the automated fix process by:

1. **Fix Review**: Displaying proposed fixes for human review before deployment
2. **Alternative Suggestions**: Providing multiple fix options when available
3. **Manual Edits**: Allowing users to edit and improve suggested fixes
4. **Feedback Loop**: Capturing user feedback to improve future fix generation
5. **Knowledge Base**: Building a library of validated fixes for future reference

## Features

- Fix review interface for human validation
- Multiple fix suggestion ranking and comparison
- Diff views for easy assessment of changes
- Feedback collection for fix quality improvement
- Integration with approval workflow

## Components

- `suggestion_manager.py`: Core suggestion generation and management
- `ranking.py`: Ranking algorithm for multiple fix options
- `feedback.py`: Feedback collection and processing
- `knowledge_base.py`: Storage of validated fixes
- `diff_viewer.py`: Tools for visualizing fix changes

## Integration

The module integrates with other Homeostasis components:

- **Analysis Module**: Receives error details for fix suggestion
- **Monitoring Module**: Tracks fix performance after deployment
- **Approval Workflow**: Routes fixes through appropriate approval chains
- **Dashboard**: Provides UI for reviewing and suggesting fixes

## Usage

```python
from modules.suggestion import SuggestionManager

# Initialize the suggestion manager
suggestion_manager = SuggestionManager()

# Generate fix suggestions for an error
fix_suggestions = suggestion_manager.generate_suggestions(error_id)

# Get top-ranked suggestion
best_fix = suggestion_manager.get_best_suggestion(error_id)

# Record feedback on a fix
suggestion_manager.record_feedback(fix_id, user_id, rating, comments)
```
