The Universal Self-Healing Standard is governed by an open, transparent, and meritocratic process. Our governance model ensures:

- **Open Participation**: Anyone can contribute
- **Transparent Decisions**: All decisions are documented
- **Technical Excellence**: Quality and innovation are prioritized
- **Vendor Neutrality**: No single company controls the standard
- **Community Focus**: Decisions benefit the entire ecosystem
