## Vision

Homeostasis is an open-source framework that mimics biological self-repair mechanisms in software systems. Just as living organisms heal injuries autonomously, Homeostasis enables applications to detect failures, generate fixes, and deploy them without human intervention.

## Goals

- **Reduce Downtime**: Automatically fix errors before they impact users
- **Decrease Manual Repairs**: Free developers from repetitive bug-fixing
- **Universal Framework**: Support multiple languages and platforms
- **Safety First**: Ensure all generated fixes are thoroughly tested
- **Open and Extensible**: Foster community-driven healing strategies

## Architecture Overview

Homeostasis implements a self-healing cycle through six interconnected modules:

1. **Monitoring & Error Collection**: Captures logs, exceptions, and performance metrics
2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Identifies underlying error causes using rules or ML
3. **Code Generation & Patching**: Creates fixes through templates or AI assistance
4. **Parallel Environment Deployment**: Tests new code in isolated environments
5. **Validation & Observation**: Verifies fixes through comprehensive test suites
6. **Hot Swap / Replacement**: Safely replaces broken components with fixed versions

## Quick Start

*Coming soon!*

## Project Status

Homeostasis is in its early development phase. We're currently:

- Setting up project infrastructure
- Designing the architecture
- Building a minimal proof-of-concept
