- Clear history and refresh statistics

## Remote Development

The plugin fully supports JetBrains Remote Development:

- Automatic detection of remote environments
- Optimized healing strategies for network latency
- Configuration synchronization between local and remote
- Increased healing delays and confidence thresholds for stability

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or higher
- Gradle 7.0 or higher

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build the plugin
./gradlew build

# Run in development IDE
./gradlew runIde

# Package for distribution
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Import Gradle project
4. Run the "runIde" Gradle task

## Configuration Options

### Server Settings
- **Server URL**: Homeostasis healing server endpoint
- **API Key**: Authentication key for server access
- **Connection Timeout**: Network timeout settings

### Healing Behavior
- **Real-time Healing**: Enable/disable automatic healing
- **Healing Delay**: Milliseconds to wait before triggering healing
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence for auto-applying fixes
- **Enabled Languages**: Select which languages to heal

### UI Preferences
- **Inline Hints**: Show healing suggestions inline
- **Inspections**: Enable Homeostasis inspections
- **Notifications**: Show healing completion notifications
- **Telemetry**: Enable usage analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Plugin not detecting errors:**
- Check that your language is enabled in settings
- Verify server connectivity in the tool window
- Ensure confidence threshold isn't set too high

**Slow healing response:**
- Increase healing delay for better performance
- Check network connectivity to healing server
- Consider disabling real-time healing for large files

**Remote development issues:**
- Verify server is accessible from remote environment
- Check that ports are properly forwarded
- Use higher confidence thresholds for stability

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by adding to IDE custom VM options:
```
-Didea.log.debug.categories=com.homeostasis.healing
```
