"""
Example test runner demonstrating how the improved healing tests would work.

This shows how the Homeostasis framework should properly handle errors:
1. Service runs normally and can handle requests
2. Errors are injected through API calls, not code modification
3. Monitoring detects runtime errors from logs
4. Patches are generated based on error analysis
5. Patches are tested in parallel environments
6. Successful patches are deployed via hot-swap
